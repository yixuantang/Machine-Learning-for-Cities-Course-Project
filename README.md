## Overview

Gas leak is a crucial risk problem in urban life. Comparing to detecting gas leak using instruments in a big city, machine learning algorithm with open data from San Francisco provides a more innovative method with less expense. However the field of gas leak detection has not been touched by researches using machine learning techniques. In this paper we applied methods as decision tree, gaussian process and location outlier factor algorithm to predict gas leak occurence and identify strong indicators of such events. Based on the result, the methods proved their worth in terms of accuracy and add value by optimizing the gas leak inspection effort. The areas with higher likelihood to have gas leak incidents and the socio-economic attributes that contribute significantly to gas leak incidents have been identified.
